# Optimization Methods for Data Science Final Project
## Data Science @Sapienza

This repository contains the following:
- The `implementation` package, with sub-packages dedicated to Kernel-based Support Vector Machines and Multilayer Perceptron Networks + Radial Basis Function Networks.
- The `OMDS_project_2022_2023` PDF, containing the instructions for the project.
- The `requirements.txt` file, describing the dependencies necessary for the code to run.
- The `ImplementationReport` PDF, describing the math and several implementation details. It is about 10 pages long, and it goes quite in depth.
- The `data.txt` file, containing the tabular data used to train and test the models for the project.

Apart from the `OMDS_project_2022_2023` PDF, authored by Professor Veronica Piccialli and Cecilia Salvatore, and the `data.txt` file, everything else was written and coded by Simone Di Gregorio and Mattia Castaldo.
